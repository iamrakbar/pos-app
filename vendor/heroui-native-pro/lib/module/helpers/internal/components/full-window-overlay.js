 * FullWindowOverlay renders content in a separate native window on iOS,
 * which allows overlays (FAB layers, dialogs, toasts) to appear above
 * native modals and the keyboard. However, this breaks the React Native
 * element inspector because it attaches to the main window.
 *
 * Set `disableFullWindowOverlay={true}` when you need to use the element
 * inspector during development. Note: when disabled, overlay content will
 * not render above native modals. iOS only; has no effect on Android.
